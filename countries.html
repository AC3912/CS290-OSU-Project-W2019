			<p>BALI, INDONESIA</p>
			<p>In Bali, I had many wonderful experiences. One of them being climbing
				a volcano named Mount Batur(see picture to the left). A driver picked 
				me and my husband up at our hotel at 2AM in the morning! It was a 2 
				hour drive to the volcano. Once we got there, people were separated 
				into groups of 4 with each tour guide. It took about 2 hours to climb 
				the volcano. At first, it was easy. However, the higher we went up the 
				steeper the climb. We witnessed the sunrise at the top of the volcano. 
				Luckily, the volcano has been dormant since about the year 2000. Crazy
				part of this story? I climbed the volcano in a skirt!

			<p>MECCA, SAUDI ARABIA</p>
			<p>In Mecca, I had a spiritual experience. Every year, there is an 
				auspicious time for Muslims to complete a pilgrimage in Mecca. Muslims
				follow the religion of Islam and have 5 pillars to follow: Belief,
				Prayer, Fasting, Zakat(Charity) and Hajj(Pilgrimage). All but the
				Hajj(Pilgrimage), is required of every Muslim. If a Muslim person
				has the financial means to complete the pilgrimage, then that pillar
				is obligatory for them. I had the privelege of completing the pilgrimage
				last year in August of 2018. Every year the date changes due to the Muslims
				following the lunar calendar. The date changes about 10 days back per year.
				The pilgrimage includes many rituals, such as circumambulating the Kaaba
				(see picture to left) 7 times, walking back and forth 7 times between
				mountains Safa and Marwa, and many more.

			<p>INDIA</p>
			<p>I went to India when I was about 6 years old. My mother is from India.
				My mother's family is not from any well known city. I do not know the
				English translation of my mother's family's village name. She is from
				Mazorbari - which translates to "middle village." But there are many 
				middle villages in India, so I am pretty sure that is not the official
				name for the village. My mother has 7 siblings - 4 brothers and 3 sisters.
				One of my uncle's family and one of my aunt's family still live in India.
				The remaining siblings are here in the US. The part of India where my
				mom is from does not keep birth records. My mother nor any of her 
				siblings know their actual birth date!

			<p>Bangladesh</p>
			<p>I have been to Bangladesh 3 times. My father is from Bangladesh. He has
				4 brothers and 5 sisters, for a grand total of 9 siblings. The last time
				I went to Bangladesh is when I was about 9 years old. My most vivid 
				memory is when I rode a motorcycle with my uncle. Since a motorcycle can
				fit only two people max, my uncle and I drove the motorcycle to my aunt's
				house. I picked some white peppers from my aunt's garden and brought it 
				back to my mom, since I knew she loved peppers. My favorite food to eat
				was a spicy chickpea dish served in a cup only on the train! The picture
				to the left is the flag of Bangladesh.
