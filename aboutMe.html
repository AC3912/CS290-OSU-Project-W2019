			<p>Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Amena.This website is just 
			   a log of my travels around the world, although I have not been to many 
			   places yet.
			</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I live in New York City (NYC). I have lived in NYC for 
				about a year. Previously, I lived in New Jersey (NJ). I was born and
				raised in NJ. In my younger years, I did not travel much. My parents
				would only travel to their respective countries - Bangladesh and 
				India. 
			
			<p>As the Countries Visited page states, I have been to Indonesia, Saudia 
			   Arabia, Bangladesh and India. My goal is to visit a different place 
			   every year.
